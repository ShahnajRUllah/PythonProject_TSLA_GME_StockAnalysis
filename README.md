# TSLA_GME_stock_data_analysis

In this project, I used webscraping to extract the revenue stock data for Tesla and Gamestop. 
I then used Pandas to store the stock data into individual dataframes.
Finally, Python's yfinance library was used to carry out visualization of the stock performance by generating a graph using the make_graph() function
